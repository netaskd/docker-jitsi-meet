# Jitsi Meet on Docker

![](resources/jitsi-docker.png)

[Jitsi](https://jitsi.org/) is a set of Open Source projects that allows you to easily build and deploy secure videoconferencing solutions.

[Jitsi Meet](https://jitsi.org/jitsi-meet/) is a fully encrypted, 100% Open Source video conferencing solution that you can use all day, every day, for free â€” with no account needed.

This repository contains the necessary tools to run a Jitsi Meet stack on [Docker](https://www.docker.com) using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

## Installation

The installation manual is available [here](https://jitsi.github.io/handbook/docs/devops-guide/devops-guide-docker).

## Additional features that included on this fork

### Images
* **turn**: [Coturn](https://github.com/coturn/coturn), the TURN server.

### Advanced configuration

#### Transcription configuration

If you want to enable the Transcribing function, these options are required:

Variable | Description | Example
--- | --- | ---
`ENABLE_JIGASI_TRANSCRIBER` | Enable Jigasi transcription in a conference | 1
`GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` | Credentials for connect to Cloud Google API from Jigasi. Path located inside the container | /config/key.json

For set `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` please read https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/quickstart-protocol section "Before you begin" from 1 to 5 paragraph

#### JItsi BRoadcasting Infrastructure configuration

For working jibri after commit jibri@5a71969 and jibri@600d4fe, you need to configure 8 capture/playback interfaces It's enough for 4 jibri instances on one node.

for Centos 7, module already compiled with kernel, so just run:
```
# configure 8 capture/playback interfaces
echo "options snd-aloop enable=1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1 index=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7" > /etc/modprobe.d/asound.conf
# setup autoload the module
echo "snd_aloop" > /etc/modules-load.d/snd_aloop.conf
# load the module
modprobe snd-aloop
# check that the module is loaded
lsmod | grep snd_aloop
```
for Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial):
```
# install the module
apt update && apt install linux-image-extra-virtual
# configure 8 capture/playback interfaces
echo "options snd-aloop enable=1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1 index=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7" > /etc/modprobe.d/asound.conf
# setup autoload the module
echo "snd-aloop" >> /etc/modules
# load the module
modprobe snd-aloop
# check that the module is loaded
lsmod | grep snd_aloop
```

#### Setting up Octo (cascaded bridges)
NOTE: For get working octo properly you have to set header "X-User-Region" before it passing to nginx. It can be realized via geoip or another logic and it's not described here.

The header "X-User-Region" will be passed through nginx and dynamically set variable for `userRegion` in config.js file via ssi nginx module.
If `userRegion` and `JVB_OCTO_REGION` the same region, user will be connected to the instanse JVB that has this region.

This behavion already preconfigured and receiving X-User-Region in config.js looks like this:

```
deploymentInfo: {
    // shard: "shard1",
    // region: europe" -->',
    userRegion: '<!--#echo var="http_x_user_region" default="us-east-1" -->'
},
```

If you want to enable the Octo cascading briges, these options are required:

Variable | Description | Default value
--- | --- | ---
`JICOFO_BRIDGE_SELECTION_STRATEGY` | Bridge selection stratagy for new connections | RegionBasedBridgeSelectionStrategy
`JVB_OCTO_BIND_PORT` | The UDP port number which the Octo relay should use | 4096
`JVB_OCTO_REGION` | The region that the jitsi-videbridge instance is in | us-east-1

The brige selection stratagy is:

* `SplitBridgeSelectionStrategy` - can be used for testing. It tries to select a new bridge for each client, regardless of the regions.

* `RegionBasedBridgeSelectionStrategy` - matches the region of the clients to the region of the Jitsi Videobridge instances. Used by default.

#### TURN(S) server
If you want to enable TURN server, configure it and run Docker Compose as
follows: ``docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f turn.yml up``

Variable | Description | Default value
--- | --- | ---
`TURN_ENABLE` | Use TURN for P2P and JVB (bridge mode) connections | 0
`TURN_REALM` | Realm to be used for the users with long-term credentials mechanism or with TURN REST API | realm
`TURN_SECRET` | Secret for connect to TURN server | keepthissecret
`TURN_TYPE` | Type of TURN(s) (turn/turns) | turns
`TURN_HOST` | Annonce FQDN/IP address of the turn server via XMPP (XEP-0215) | 192.168.1.1
`TURN_PUBLIC_IP` | Public IP address for an instance of turn server | set dynamically
`TURN_PORT` | TLS/TCP/UDP turn port for connection | 5349
`TURN_TRANSPORT` | transport for turn connection (tcp/udp) | tcp
`TURN_RTP_MIN` | RTP start port for turn/turns connections | 16000
`TURN_RTP_MAX` | RTP end port for turn/turns connections | 17000

For enable web-admin panel for turn, please set variables below

Variable | Description | Default value
--- | --- | ---
`TURN_ADMIN_ENABLE` | Enable web-admin panel | 0
`TURN_ADMIN_USER` | Username for admin panel | admin
`TURN_ADMIN_SECRET` | Password for admin panel | changeme
`TURN_ADMIN_PORT` | HTTP(s) port for acess to admin panel | 8443

#### WebSockets for XMPP and JVB connections.

If you want to enable the WebSockets for XMPP and JVB, these options are required:

Variable | Description | Default value
--- | --- | ---
`JVB_WS_ENABLE` | Enable WebSockets for XMPP (prosody) and JVB connections | 0
